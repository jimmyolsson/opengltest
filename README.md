# Overview
This project serves as a scratchpad of sorts for me to learn graphics programing. It's currently a minecraft clone built using OpenGL and C/C++.

A playable WebGL version can be found [here](https://jimmyolsson.github.io/).  
_**NOTE:** The WebGL version lacks sound and noise terrain generation._
